<h3>Like moths to a flow state</h3>
<p class="blurb">I design and develop experiences, systems, flows, software,
  and applications that are shaped by the demonstrated needs and preferences of
  real users and customers. Rooted in complexity theory, systems thinking, and
  radical empathy, I try to surf the crest of the wave of innovation,
  applying the latest technology to our most pressing challenges.</p>
