    <p>My favorite project during my years at SolarCity was something we
      called Green Ops. Centered around a sustainability manifesto, we
      aligned our sales team of thousands, culminating in a thrilling
      chant: "Take the Power Back!" It was glorious.</p>

    <p>Overall, I designed, prototyped, and developed a slew of digital
      experiences for customers and employees. With Leadgen we were able
      to drastically improve the quality of our lead collection practices in the field. With Dynamo and Go, we debuted the world's first DIY custom solar home design experience for prospective customers.</p>
