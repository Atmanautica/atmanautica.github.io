    <p>For SolarCity I designed, prototyped, and developed a slew of digital experiences for customers and employees. We were able to drastically improve the quality of our lead collection practices in the field with a simple web app I called Leadgen. With Dynamo and Go, we debuted the world's first DIY home solar energy experience for prospective customers.</p>

    <p>My favorite project during my years at SolarCity was something we
      called Green Ops. Centered around a sustainability manifesto, we
      aligned our sales team of thousands, culminating in a thrilling
      chant: "Take the Power Back!" It was glorious.</p>
