<p>We're equal parts quick study and diehard idealist, jacks of all trades
  on the paths to mastery. We are super grateful for the panorama of
  opportunities our career, adventures, and studies provide us, opportunities
  to be of service to humanity and to our Lover Nature. And while we
  recognize that we do not yet inhabit the more beautiful world our hearts
  know is possible, we devote ourself to the garden.</p>
<p>More concretely, we use ECMAScript, HTML, and CSS in many forms to rapidly
prototype and test concepts and designs with the users they are intended to
benefit. We design the complete journey, and develop the full stack. We are
equally experienced with venture-backed startups, small and medium businesses,
and Big Corporate.</p>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>For years we have championed and pioneered the work and life
methodologies that are now becoming commonplace: radical anti-oppression,
radical empathy, and radical honesty, paired programming, agile, lean,
test-driven MVP development, decentralized, remote collaboration with Slack,
Asana, Trello, Github, and Zoom (though now we use Google Meet).</p>
