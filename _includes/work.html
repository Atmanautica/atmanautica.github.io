    share of our work (and indeed some of the work of which we are most proud)
    has occurred in close collaboration with teams and remains under closed
    source. We do not claim authorship of all the work featured here, nor can
    we hope to tease out every individual contribution. If you are a
    collaborator who would like explicit attribution for any of this, please
