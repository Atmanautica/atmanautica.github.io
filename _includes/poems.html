<h2>Request a Poem</h2>
<p>I would <b>LOVE 💝</b> to write a poem for you. If you want this too,
  please <a href="mailto:kerry@atmanaut.me" target="_blank">send me a prompt</a>.
  Perhaps an image that gets you right in the feels. Better still, send me a
  story, a dream, a feeling, something you rarely share but could never
  forget.
