        If you stop by in a more than a bit and less than ages, you may be
        greeted by a being who calls itself Teran McWatken. From its nose
        emanates future histories of an intergalactic elven psychonaut while its
        mouth simultaneously intones the bliss and wisdom of timeless formless
        shapelessness in seven ancient mother tongues. It's in the concept
        phase.
