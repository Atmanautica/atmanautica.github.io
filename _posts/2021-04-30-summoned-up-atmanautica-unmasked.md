It seems to me that 2021 will be the year the masks come off. So here goes nothing.

Consulting as Atmanautica has been a treat. I've relished the freedom to play many roles for clients of many ilks and inklings. And today I'm hanging up that [silly hat](/assets/img/silly-hats.gif) and donning a whole basket of other ones as a co-founder of [Summon](https://summon.app) aside the brilliant Islam Sharabash.

We've been filling our sleeves with magic tricks, and are excited to start the show and **let teams flow**.

As for Atmanautica, I'm decommissioning the moniker and dropping the mask.

May we all become maskless, at ease, and fancy-free as we re-inhabit this post-[Coronation](https://charleseisenstein.org/essays/the-coronation/) planet.
