For a while I have shamelessly poached [this wavy purple Vanta.js
background](https://www.vantajs.com/?effect=waves), plopping it behind
otherwise lackluster content to add panache/pizzazz. Who doesn't love nice
wrapping paper? I love it, and origami, hence what you are seeing dance right
now.

As it turns out there are a host of other wonderful animated backgrounds for
your web sites/apps/pages. Let's give them a spin, shall we?
