As it turns out there are a host of other wonderful animated backgrounds for
your web sites/apps/pages. Let's give them a spin, shall we?

## Some schmancy animated background demos
- [3 demoes with customizable circles and squares from Wweb.dev](https://wweb.dev/resources/animated-css-background-generator)
- [5 ambient dealies from Codrops](https://tympanus.net/Development/AmbientCanvasBackgrounds/index4.html)
- [THPACE! - Thay it thrice](https://www.braedin.com/Thpace/)
- [Naker.back interactive customizable](https://app.naker.io/back/)
- [GeoPattern - procedurally generated?](https://btmills.github.io/geopattern/)
- [Vanta - nearly dozens more](https://www.vantajs.com/?effect=halo)

And an honorable mention to <a href="https://wweb.dev/resources/creative-backgrounds">this compendium</a> of otherwise decorative but
non-animated backgrounds.

For a while I have shamelessly poached [this wavy purple Vanta.js
background](https://www.vantajs.com/?effect=waves), plopping it behind
otherwise lackluster content to add panache/pizzazz. Who doesn't love nice
wrapping paper? I love it, and origami, hence what you are seeing dance right
now.

The crux is getting them loaded without blocking the render or other aspects
of the page load, then building them in gracefully.
