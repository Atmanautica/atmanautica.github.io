Well, that didn't take long. Spun up, deployed, and now running a Sanity CMS with a Next.js client app in minutes. Like 13 of them.

So [Easeness](https://easeness.biz) is off to the races (Next.js is super snappy in SSG mode) and giddily gliding along on a flying pillow of [Sanity](https://sanity.io). And I couldn't be happier with the ease of development and the vibrant, supportive communities around both Next.js and Sanity.io.

Now we've got a [Sanity CMS deployed on Vercel](https://www.sanity.io/guides/creating-a-sanity-and-vercel-1-click-starter) and accessible locally. And a Next.js client app drawing data from Sanity, piggybacking on the [rad starter kit](https://create.sanity.io/?template=brob/sanity-template-nextjs-blog-comments) from Sanity.

Sanity's schema and studio interface are delightfully customizable, so in the near future I'll be able to migrate my folio over into a rich graph.
