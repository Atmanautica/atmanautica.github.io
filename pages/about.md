# Who am I?

I am plural, more *us* than *me*  
who are we?  
spirit-soul-mind-body  
lover-healer-partner-buddy  
brother-son-father-to-be  
citizen-neighbor-friend  
entrepreneur-fl√¢neur-amateur  
experiencer-experiencing-experience  
producer-developer-designer  
recovering intellectual property attorney  
owlionightingalehorsebearmothbeemutt  
budding gardener-chef-brewer  
storybook writer  
poet-as-pupa  
yantric artist  
esoteric acolyte  
card-carrying un-ist  
loving awareness

and truly we are none of these nouns, these bubbles  
we are always only echoing in the vibratory field  
of being-knowing-enjoying  
we are embodying patterns in the foam emerging still and silent  
from the well of being seated at the core of our heart-center
