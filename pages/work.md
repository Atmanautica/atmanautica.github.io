## Atmanautica
- The quest to know thyself can be a lonely affair. Atmanautica is where we can let our tears dry, let our hearts breathe, and let the suffering fall away. Following a series of profound experiences of unity, we have devoted ourself to providing support and guidance for those who forget what is and seek meaning and progress. We ask the questions long left unanswered.
- Golang, Hugo, JS, CSS, HTML, poetry, blog, prana, wu wei, satori

## Passage
- A breathing, dancing percentage clock designed for huge and tiny screens. Can a clock help us enjoy the passage of time?
- JS, HTML, CSS, modules, components, promises, responsive design, home screen web app, synchronicity

## Mandarin9
- Learning Mandarin as an adult is no small feat. At the very least it can be entertaining. We did our best to bring an effective, engaging Mandarin language-learning platform to the West.
- Wordpress, JS, HTML, CSS, user research, persona building, web marketing, tech strategy,

## Arrivo
- "Don't let Earth suck" sang the gargantuan neon sign at HQ. We assembled all-stars and avengers to put an end to traffic. The world might not be ready for a hyperloop, but aren't we ready to arrive?
- It was a blessing and a joy to think so big. To inform our ambitions, we created a comprehensive timeline of transportation technology. We also got to architect the IT infrastructure, coordinate the move into our HQ, and learn to juggle operations duties. And that golf machine!

## Solarcity
- We don't have to burn the Earth to fuel our progress. At least that's what we agreed upon at SolarCity in the old days. These days we're not sure any measure of progress is possible or valuable, but that's another story for another day.
- Our favorite project during our three-year tenure here was Green Ops. We wrote a manifesto for the sales team, and got them all chanting riotously: "Take the Power Back". It was glorious.
- We built a lot of software and designed and prototyped many digital experiences for customers and employees. With Leadgen we were able to drastically improve the quality of our lead collection practices in the field. With Dynamo and Go, we debuted the world's first DIY custom solar home design experience for prospective customers.

## Disney
- Our acquisition got off to a rough start when WDC decided to sunset our Togetherville platform and all of our products and services a mere six months after our arrival. The silver lining was the opportunity to apply our technological acumen to dream up the magical (and plausible) wonders that Disney could bring to the world.
- While we were tasked with integrating the company's identity platforms into what we termed Disney ID, we came up with a Disney-style precursor to Pokemon Go, what we call Your Disney that became Disney+, and an evolution of Disney Pins involving wearable smart collectibles that they now call Magic Bands, to name a few that are now finally declassified.

## Togetherville
- If you have seen Mike Judge's show called Silicon Valley, you have seen a network. At that point kids were illegally joining Facebook in droves and bullying was becoming insidious and vicious. But Facebook was only us and promised us salvation.
- We were fully committed to giving kids and their families a safe, fun social network. At that point kids were illegally joining Facebook in droves and bullying was becoming insidious and vicious. But Facebook was only beginning its meteoric rise, and there were [still more people than smartphones on the planet](https://qz.com/1608103/there-are-now-more-cellphones-than-people-in-the-world/).

## Third Prime
- Four talented, ambitious industrial designers and yours truly teamed up during the Great Recession to bring some healing and humor to the world. Our most successful product, the Hope and Healing Hands Cart, is still bring an experience of nature outdoors to children whose health is too compromised to allow them to safely play outside. We were just kids at the time, we were still in law school, and we learned many things the hard way at this first stab at entrepreneurship.
